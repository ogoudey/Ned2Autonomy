# Ned2Autonomy

## Installation
To do the experiment, install all dependencies. We recommend using pip:
```
pip install pygame pyniryo torch numpy
```

## Experiment

### Setup
Connect the XBox controller, and follow the Ned2 Beginner Guide to connect to Ned (connecting to Ned takes a while).

Around Ned, position the elements in the setting, or update the setting to new positions.

### Running
From the root directory, run the control.py python script.

```
$ python3 control.py
```
Ned then alternates between a teleoperation mode and an "autonomous" mode. If desired, from within the teleoperation mode, press X to switch to autonomous control.
