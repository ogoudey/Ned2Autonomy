# Ned2Autonomy

## Remote Control

### Quickstart:
Follow the Ned2 Beginner Guide to affirm connection, and connect the XBox controller. Then fire up python from within /remote_control. Then run
```
>>>import main
>>>ned = main.ned_init()
>>>main.parameters(ned)
>>>main.remote_control_activate(ned)
```
and you're off.
### Credit:
Code is based off of Si Liu's code for a prior project.

Ned2_beginner_guide.md is entirely from her project at this point.
